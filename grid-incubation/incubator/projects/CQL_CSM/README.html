			README for cql_csm
		</h1>
		<p>
			This is version 1.3.1 of cql_csm. Cql_csm includes a replacement for
			the CQL processor used by introduce-generated data services that are
			configured to use CSM instance-level security to control which table
			rows or objects are accessible to a user. The reason a replacement is
			needed for the default CQL processor is that the way the default CQL
			processor works is unsuitable for many security use cases.
		</p>
		<p>
			This version of cql_csm also include a CQL pre-processor that can be
			integrated with any caGrid data service to provide instance-level
			security. It works by adding constraints to a query that are needed
			to enforce CSM-based authorization policies. It is independent of the
			type of data store that the data service queries. The current version
			of xService includes integeration support for this pre-processor.

		<h2>
			<a name="theProblem" />The Security Problems that CQL_CSM Solves
		</h2>
		<p />
		The CQL_CSM library is mechanism for enforcing CSM-based authorization
		policies that can be used instead of the CAM-API. It exists to solve
		two problems with the CSM-API:
		<ul>
			<li>
				When used in a cGrid data service, the design for the CSM-API leaves
				a security hole open.
			</li>
			<li>
				The CSM-API only provides instance-level security for data in
				relational databases that is accessed through hibernate.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			These issues are discussed in under the following headings.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Vulnerability through Probing of caCORE-Based Data Services
		</h3>
		<p>
			There is a potential vulnerability in the security provided by the
			CSM-caCORE integration that uses the CSM-API. Queries can probe for
			the existence of records containing specific attribute values in
			records that a user is not authorized to access. Consider this
			scenario:
		</p>
		<p>
			Suppose that the OpenClinica data service has two users named X and
			Y. Among the things that OpenClinica tracks are studies and subjects,
			which have a many-to-many relationship to each other.
		</p>
		<p>
			User X is supposed to have access to study A and all subjects
			associated with study A. User Y is supposed to have access to study B
			and all subjects associated with study B. We do not want user X to be
			able to tell which subjects in study A are also in study B.
			Similarly, we do not want user Y to be able to tell which subjects in
			study B are also in study A. However, CSM does not allow us to
			prevent this.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is how it works. For the Study class we set up a filter that
			will only match a specified set of study names. For the Subject
			class, we set up a filter that will only match Subjects that are
			associated with a Study that matches a specified set of study names.
			For user X we specify that the study name to filter for is A. For
			user Y we specify that the study name to filter for is B.
		</p>
		<p>
			The problem is that when we issue a query, CSM does not use both
			filters. It just uses the filter that matches the class that we want
			to return an instance of. If user X issues a query asking for all of
			the subjects that are associated with study B, CMS only uses the
			filter for Subject. It ignored the filter for Study. For this query,
			there will be no filtering on Study, so the Subject filter will
			remove subjects that are not associated with study A and the query is
			free to find subjects among those that are also associated with study
			B.
			<br />
		</p>

		<p>
			This vulnerability, if exploited with enough time and ingenuity, will
			allow people who are able to retrieve just one record in a database
			to learn the contents of the rest of the database.
		</p>
		<p>
			To solve this problem, the CQL_CSM library provides a replacement for
			the standard CQL processor that is used by caCORE-based data
			services.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Support for Data Sources Other Than Relational Database
		</h3>
		<p>
			The CSM-API support for instance-level security only works for
			relational databases that are accessed through hibernate. To provide
			instance-level security in other situations, the CQL-CSL library
			provides a CQL pre-preprocessor. It takes a CQL query and modifies
			the query to include constraints based on relevant CSM policies that
			limit the results of the query to only those objects that the query
			issuer is authorized to read.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since the pre-processor deals only with CQL, it is independent of the
			type of data source that a data service uses. It relies on the
			existing CQL processor to translate CQL queries into something that
			work with the underlying data source.
		</p>
		<h2>
			<a name="testEnvironment" />The Environment that the CQL_CSM
			Replacement CQL Processor was Tested in.
		</h2>
		<p>
			CQL_CSM replacement CQL processor was tested in an environment that
			consisted of the following components:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The CENTOS 5.5 distribution of Linux.
			</li>
			<li>
				Java 1.5
			</li>
			<li>
				caGrid 1.3
			</li>
			<li>
				caCORE 4.1.1 (later versions may work.&nbsp; Versions before 4.1.1
				are
				<strong>not</strong> supported.)
			</li>
			<li>
				PostgreSQL 8.1 and MySql 5.0 (in alternate environments.&nbsp; Not
				at the same time.)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			<a name="install" />How to install CQL_CSM Replacement CQL Processor
		</h2>
		The following steps assume
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					The data service does not use the caCORE SDK&apos;s writable API.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The data service uses a database that has case-insensitive table
					names. The replacement CQL processor
					<i>may</i> not work correctly if table names are case sensitive.
					The CSM service that is used to administer CSM authorization
					policies will
					<i>definitely not</i> work correctly with case-sensistive table
					names. MySql on Linux can be made to have case-insensitive table
					names by setting the lower_case_table_names system variable to 1.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The root directory used to build and deploy the data service is
					identified as
					<tt>$APP_LOCATION</tt>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The top-level directory of the CQL_CSM distribution is identified
					as
					<tt>$CQL_CSM_LOCATION</tt>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The name of the database whose data the data service accesses is
					represented in paths and file names as
					<tt><i>dbName</i> </tt>.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		Some of the steps the follow assume the existence of a directory named
		<tt>local-client</tt>.
		<ol>
			<li>
				Create an introduce-generated caGrid data service that is configured
				to access the data of a caCORE application through the
				&ldquo;local&rdquo; interface.
				<p>
					It does not matter if it is configured to use CSM security.
					However, if it is configured to use CSM security, be sure to note
					the value of the
					<tt>CSM_PROJECT_NAME</tt> property in the caCORE SDK's
					<tt>conf/deploy.properties</tt> file. This will be the value that
					you will want to use for the application name when administering
					CSM security policies.
				</p>
				<p />
				At the time of this writing, Introduce support for caCORE SDK 4.1.1
				appears to have a bug that causes it to not copy all of the needed
				<tt>.jar</tt> files from the generated
				<tt>package/local-client/lib</tt> directory. If you find that your
				data service is failing due to classes not being found, look for the
				missing .jar files in the generated
				<tt>package/local-client/lib</tt> directory and copy them to your
				data service&apos;s
				<tt>lib</tt> and
				<tt>build/lib</tt> directories. Files known to not be copied because
				of this bug include:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<tt>ehcache-1.2.2.jar</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>c3p0-0.9.0.jar</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>mysql-connector-java-3.1.13-bin.jar</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>jta.jar</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>org.dom4j</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>csmapi-4.1.jar</tt>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p />
				The data service should be running in a secure container.
				<p>
					Note that because the data service is configured to use the local
					API, works directly with the relevant database. The caGRID data
					service can run without the caCORE application running.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Do not continue to the next step until this is working.</b>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Issue the commands
					<br />
					<tt>cd $CQL_CSM_LOCATION</tt>
					<br />
					<tt>ant clean all</tt>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Issue the commands
				<br />
				<tt>cd $APP_LOCATION</tt>
				<br />
				<tt>ant clean</tt>
				<p>
					It is important to do a clean operation at this time without
					building anything.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Make a backup code of the
				<tt>$APP_LOCATION</tt> directory.
				<br />
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				Copy
				<tt>$CQL_CSM_LOCATION/build/lib/cql_csm_cacore_1.3.1.jar</tt> to
				<tt>$APP_LOCATION/lib</tt>.
				<br />
				<p>
					This is the .jar file that contains the CQL processor replacement.
				</p>
			</li>
			<!--
			<li>
				<p>Copy
                <tt>$CQL_CSM_LOCATION/caGrid_lib/sdk-client-framework.jar</tt> and <nobr><tt>$CQL_CSM_LOCATION/caGrid_lib/sdk-core.jar</tt></nobr> to
                <nobr><tt>$APP_LOCATION/lib</tt></nobr>.</p>
			</li>
-->
			<li>
				In this step, you will be modifying the contents of an
				<tt>.jar</tt> file whose name follows the pattern
				<nobr>
					<tt>$APP_LOCATION/lib/<i>dbName</i>&#x2011;config.jar</tt>
				</nobr>
				. For example, if the name of the database is
				<tt>jhusnpdb</tt>, then the actual file name will be
				<nobr>
					<tt><tt>$APP_LOCATION/lib</tt>/<i>jhusnpdb</i>&#x2011;config.jar</tt>
				</nobr>
				.
				<p>
					The recommended approach to editing
					<tt>.jar</tt> files is to extract the contents of the
					<tt>.jar</tt> file into a like-named subdirectory, edit the files
					in the subdirectories and then rebuild the
					<tt>.jar</tt> files. If you use an editor such as emacs that can
					edit files inside of a .jar file, that will also work.
				</p>
				<p>
					Edit the XML for a spring bean that determines the class that the
					data service uses to process CQL queries. This is in a file named
					<tt>application&#x2011;config.xml</tt> in the
					<tt>.jar</tt> file
					<tt><i>dbName</i>&#x2011;local&#x2011;config.jar</tt>. For example,
					if the name of the database is
					<tt>snpdb</tt> then the name of the .jar file will be
					<tt>snpdb&#x2011;local&#x2011;config.jar</tt>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The
					<tt>application&#x2011;config.xml</tt> file contains a spring bean
					that looks like this:

&lt;bean name="ApplicationServiceImpl" class="gov.nih.nci.system.applicationservice.impl.ApplicationServiceImpl" singleton="true"&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg ref="ClassCache" index="0"&gt;&lt;/constructor-arg&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</pre>
				Change
				<br />
				<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gov.nih.nci.system.applicationservice.impl.ApplicationServiceImpl</tt>
				<br />
				to
				<br />
				<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edu.emory.cci.cqlCsm.cqlCsmHibernate.ApplicationServiceImpl</tt>
				<br />
				When you are done, the spring bean should look like this:

    &lt;constructor-arg ref="ClassCache" index="0"&gt;&lt;/constructor-arg&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</pre>
				<hr />
				<p>
					This file contains another spring bean that looks like this:
				</p>
				<pre>&lt;bean name="ClassCache" class="gov.nih.nci.system.util.ClassCache" singleton="true"&gt;
  &lt;property name="daoList"&gt;
    &lt;list&gt;

      &lt;ref bean="ORMDAOFactory"/&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</pre>
				<p>
					Comment out the reference to the
					<tt>ORMDAOFactory</tt> like this:

&lt;/bean&gt;</pre>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Further in this file are additional spring beans named

				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Near the end of the file is a spring bean that looks like this:

        &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</pre>
				<p>
					Comment out the

&lt;/bean&gt;</pre>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					cd to
					<tt>$APP_LOCATION and issue the appropriate command to deploy
						the data service to its container.</tt>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Install the CSM service on the same host as your data service. You
					will use this to administer instance level security and any other
					sorts of CSM security policies that you may be using. You can
					download the CSM service from
					<a href="http://www.inventrio.com/solutions/downloads">the
						Inventrio downloads page</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Read this installation step completely before installing the
						CSM service.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					The installation instructions for the CSM service describe a step
					titled, &ldquo;Step 6: Initialize CSM database or tables
					(optional)&rdquo;. You will need to create CSM tables in the same
					database that your data service uses if they do not already exist.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are using a MySql database, be sure to use the command
					<br />
					<tt>ant createMysqlCsmTables</tt>
					<br />
					as described in the installation instructions to create the CSM
					tables in your existing database.
					<font color="red">Do not use the command <br /> <tt>ant
							createMysqlCsmDatabase</tt> <br /> which will <b>delete your
							existing database</b>!! </font>
				</p>
				<p />
				If you are configuring your data service to use a different user ID
				to access the MySql database than the user ID that owns the CSM
				tables (recommended), you will need to grant select permission on
				the CSM tables to that user ID that the data service will be using.
				The names of these tables are:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_APPLICATION</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_FILTER_CLAUSE</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_GROUP</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_PG_PE</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_PRIVILEGE</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_PROTECTION_ELEMENT</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_PROTECTION_GROUP</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_REMOTE_GROUP</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_REMOTE_GROUP_SYNC_RECORD</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_ROLE</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_ROLE_PRIVILEGE</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_USER</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_USER_GROUP</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_USER_GROUP_ROLE_PG</tt>
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>CSM_USER_PE</tt>
					</li>
				</ul>
				You will also need to grant
				<tt>INSERT</tt> on the table
				<tt>CSM_APPLICATION</tt>.
				<p>
					If you are using a PosgreSQL database, the process for creating the
					CSM database tables is not documented in the CSM service
					installation. The rest of this step discusses how to create the CSM
					tables for PostgreSQL.
				</p>
				<p />
				Create three user IDs for the database.
				<ul>
					<li>
						One user must be have the id
						<tt>csm</tt>. This user must be created with
						<tt>CREATEDB</tt>. This user will own the CSM tables but not be
						used for any runtime or production purposes.
					</li>
					<li>
						One user must have the id
						<tt>csm_adm</tt>. This user ID will be granted permissions needed
						to modify the contents of the CSM tables. The CSM service should
						be configured to use the
						<tt>csm_adm</tt> id for connecting to the database.
					</li>
					<li>
						The other user must have the id
						<tt>csm_app</tt>. This user will be granted read-only access to
						the CSM tables. Your data service should use the
						<tt>csm_app</tt> id for connecting to the database.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Edit the file
					<tt>$CQL_CSM_LOCATION.build.xml</tt>. Change the line that looks
					like
					<br />
					<tt>&lt;property name="csm.postgresql.csm.dbname"
						value="ivi_csm"/&gt;</tt>
					<br />
					so that the value of the property is the name of the database your
					data service will be using. For example, if the name of the
					database is
					<tt>snpdb</tt>, then change the line to look like
					<br />
					<tt>&lt;property name="csm.postgresql.csm.dbname"
						value="snpdb"/&gt;</tt>
				</p>
				<p>
					cd to
					<tt>$CQL_CSM_LOCATION</tt>. Issue the command
					<br />
					<tt>ant createPostgresqlCsmTables</tt>
					<br />
					This creates the CSM tables.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first time that you issue this command, it will prompt you for
					some information about your database. It collects this information
					in the file
					<tt>$CQL_CSM_LOCATION/CSM_pg/csm.properties</tt>. Subsequent times
					that you issue this command it will not prompt you for this
					information. Instead, it will read the stored information from the
					file. If you want to enter different information, then edit or
					delete the file.
					<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					When you have finished creating the CSM tables, you will also have
					created the file
					<tt>$CSM_CQL_LOCATION/CSM_pg/csm.properties</tt>. This file can be
					used to configure the CSM service. When you get to the place in the
					CSM service installation instructions where it tells you to edit a
					file named
					<tt>csm.properties</tt> you should first copy
					<tt>$CSM_CQL_LOCATION/CSM_pg/csm.properties</tt> over that file.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					You will need a
					<tt>csm.properties</tt> file. If you are using a PostgreSQL
					database, you created a suitable
					<tt>csm.properties</tt> file in the previous installation step. If
					you are using a MySql database, then you will need to manually
					create a
					<tt>csm.properties</tt> file by copying the following sample.
				</p>
				<pre>csm.database.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
csm.database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/snpdb
csm.database.user=csm_app
csm.database.password=xxx
csm.appName=data_service</pre>
				All of the properties in the sample must be present in the
				<tt>csm.properties</tt> file:
				<dl>
					<dt>
						<tt>csm.database.driver</tt>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						The value of this should be the name of the class to use rfor the
						JDBC database driver. The usual value of this for a MySql database
						is
						<tt>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</tt>.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						<tt>csm.database.url</tt>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						The value of this should be the URL to use for creating a JDBC
						connection to the database.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						<tt>csm.database.user</tt>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						The user name that the data service should use for logging into
						the database.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						<tt>csm.database.password</tt>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						The password that the data service should use for logging into the
						database.
					</dd>
					<dt>
						<tt>csm.appName</tt>

						The name you want to use to identify the data service in the CSM

				<p>
					At this point you should have a
					<tt>csm.properties</tt> file, either from manually creating it in
					the previous installation step if you are using a MySql database or
					by automatically creating it in the step before that if you are
					using a PostgreSQL database. You need to copy your
					<tt>csm.properties</tt> file to the appropriate directory in the
					container for your data service.
				</p>
				<p>
					Depending on which type of container the data service is in, the
					directory path will be different. There will be a directory under
					which most files related to your data service live. Under that
					directory will be a directory named
					<tt>etc</tt>. Under that directory will be a directory with a name
					like
					<tt>cagrid_<i>dataServiceName</i> </tt>, where
					<tt><i>dataServiceName</i> </tt> is the name of the data service.
					For example, if the container being used is tomcat and the name of
					the data service is SnpDataService then the directory to which you
					should copy the
					<tt>csm.properties</tt> file is
					<tt>$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/wsrf/WEB-INF/etc/cagrid_SnpDataService</tt>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Deploy the data service and start its container. If everything is
					working correctly, at this point all of your functional tests for
					the data service should behave exactly as they did before you
					configured the data service to use the CQL_CSM replacement CQL
					processor. The way that CSM instance level security works is that
					until you configure at least one CSM filter for a class,
					unrestricted access to all of the class&apos;s instances is
					assumed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Performing this test step is
					<b>not optional.</b> Until you exercise the newly configured data
					service for the first time, it will not be registered in the CSM
					tables and you will not be able to configure CSM authorization
					policies for the data service.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					You are now ready to configure CSM authorization policies. This is
					described in the accompanying word document
					<tt>Configuration.docx</tt>.

		<h2>
			<a name="preprocessTest" />CQL Pre-Processor Test Environment
		</h2>
		<p>
			The CQL pre-processor was tested in an environment that consisted of
			the following components:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The CENTOS 5.2 distribution of Linux.
			</li>
			<li>
				Java 1.5
			</li>
			<li>
				caGrid 1.2
			</li>
			<li>
				xService 1.3.5
			</li>
			<li>
				PostgreSQL 8.1.18
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			<a name="preprocessor" />How to integrate with the preprocessor
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you are integrating the preprocessor with a data service that is
			based on xService, then you are in luck. Current versions of xService
			(1.3.5 or later) can be integrated with the CQL pre-processor without
			writing any code. In other circumstances, there is a simple interface
			to use for modifying a data service to use the pre-processor.
		</p>
		<p>
			In all cases, the data service will need access to the
			<tt>.jar</tt> that contains the pre-processor. The name of the
			<tt>.jar</tt> file is
			<tt>cql_csm-1.3.1.jar</tt>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do not have the source to build the data service that you are
			integrating with, you can add the
			<tt>.jar</tt> to the appropriate
			<tt>lib</tt> directory. However, if you are building the data service
			from source using a project whose dependencies are managed with ivy,
			then the recommended way to include the
			<tt>.jar</tt> file in you build is to add an ivy dependency that will
			copy it from CCI&apos;s repository.
		</p>
		<p>
			Add this to the dependencies in the project&apos;s
			<tt>ivy.xml</tt>.
		</p>
		<pre>&lt;dependency org="edu.emory.cci" name="cql_csm" rev="1.3.1-beta4" /&gt;</pre>
		<p>
			Under the top-level directory of your tree, in the
			<tt>antfiles/ivy/ivysettings.xml</tt> file, as the last element in
		</p>
		<pre>
&lt;ivysettings&gt;
  ...
  &lt;resolvers&gt;
    &lt;chain&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/chain&gt;
  &lt;/resolvers&gt;
&lt;/ivysettings&gt;
</pre>
		<p>
			add this
		</p>
		<pre>
      &lt;url name="cci-resolver" m2compatible="true"&gt;
        &lt;artifact pattern="http://repo.cci.emory.edu:8081/artifactory/libs-releases-local/[organization]/[module]/[revision]/[artifact]-[revision].[ext]" /&gt;
        &lt;artifact pattern="http://repo.cci.emory.edu:8081/artifactory/libs-releases-local/[organization]/[module]/[revision]/[artifact].[ext]" /&gt;

		<p>
			To integrate the CQL pre-processor with a data service based on
			xService, you just need to have a service property named
			<tt>CqlPreprocessor_ClassName</tt>. If this service property has a
			non-blank value, xService assumes that the value of the property is
			the name of a class that it should use as a CQL pre-processor.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are two recommended values for for the
			<tt>CqlPreprocessor_ClassName</tt> service property. The value
			<tt>edu.emory.cci.cqlCsm.cqlCsmCql.CqlNullPreprocessor</tt> will
			cause xService to call a pre-processor that just returns the query
			without any modification. This is a good choice when no
			instance-level security is needed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The other recommended value for the
			<tt>CqlPreprocessor_ClassName</tt> service property is
			<tt>edu.emory.cci.cqlCsm.cqlCsmCql.CqlCsmPreprocessor</tt>. This
			value will cause xService to call the pre-processor that adds
			constraints based on CSM policies.
		</p>
		<p>
			To integerate the CQL pre-precessor with a data service that does not
			use xService, you will need to modify the its CQL processor to pass
			each CQL query to the pre-processor and then use the possibly
			modified CQL query that is returned by the pre=processor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Both of the pre-processor classes mentioned in the preceding
			paragraphs can be instantiated with a no-argument constructor. The
			both implement the interface
			<tt>edu.emory.cci.cqlCsm.cqlCsmCql.CqlPreprocessor</tt>. Here is the
			definition of the interface:
		</p>
		<pre>
public interface CqlPreprocessor {
    /**
     * Pre-process/re-write/transform the given CQL query and return the
     * transformed CQL query.
     * 
     * @param query The query to be pre-processed/re-written/transformed.
     * @param user The identity of the user this is for.
     * @return The pre-processed/re-written/transformed CQL query.
     */
    public CQLQuery preprocess(CQLQuery query, String user);
}</pre>
		<p>
			The CQL pre-processor uses a PostgreSQL database to store CSM
			authorization policies. You will need to make sure that PosegreSQL is
			installed. The pre-processor was tested with PostgreSQL 8.1, but more
			recent versions should work.
		</p>
		<p />
		Create three PostgreSQL user ID:
		<ul>
			<li>
				One user must be have the id
				<tt>csm</tt>. This user must be created with
				<tt>CREATEDB</tt>. This user ID will own the CSM tables but not be
				used for any runtime or production purposes.
			</li>
			<li>
				One user must have the id
				<tt>csm_adm</tt>. This user ID will be granted permissions needed to
				read and modify the contents of the CSM tables. The CSM service,
				which you will use to administer CSM authorization policies, should
				be configured to use the
				<tt>csm_adm</tt> id for connecting to the database.
			</li>
			<li>
				The other user must have the id
				<tt>csm_app</tt>. This user will be granted read-only access to the
				CSM tables. Your data service will use the
				<tt>csm_app</tt> id for connecting to the database.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p />
		cd to the tope-level directory of the CQL_CSM distribution. Issue the
		command
		<br />
		<tt>ant createPostgresqlCsmTables</tt>
		<br />
		This creates the CSM tables.
		<p>
			The first time that you issue this command, it will prompt you for
			some information about your database. It collects this information in
			the file
			<tt>CSM_pg/csm.properties</tt>. Subsequent times that you issue this
			command it will not prompt you for this information. Instead, it will
			read the stored information from the file. If you want to enter
			different information, then edit or delete the file.
			<br />
			<br/>
			When you have finished creating the CSM tables, you will also have
			created the file
			<tt>CSM_pg/csm.properties</tt>. This file can be used to configure
			the CSM service. When you get to the place in the CSM service
			installation instructions where it tells you to edit a file named
			<tt>csm.properties</tt> you should first copy
			<tt>CSM_pg/csm.properties</tt> over that file.
			<p />
			You will also need to copy
			<tt>CSM_pg/csm.properties</tt> into your deployed data service so
			that the CQL pre-processor can find it.
			<p />
			Depending on which type of container the data service is in, the
			directory path will be different. There will be a directory under
			which most files related to your data service live. Under that
			directory will be a directory named
			<tt>etc</tt>. Under that directory will be a directory with a name
			like
			<tt>cagrid_<i>dataServiceName</i> </tt>, where
			<tt><i>dataServiceName</i> </tt> is the name of the data service. For
			example, if the container being used is tomcat and the name of the
			data service is SnpDataService then the directory to which you should
			copy the
			<tt>csm.properties</tt> file is
			<tt>$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/wsrf/WEB-INF/etc/cagrid_SnpDataService</tt>
		<p>
			The next step is to install the CSM service and its GAARDS client.
			You can get the version of the CSM service that corresponds to the
			beta release by checking it out of subversion from
			<tt>https://svn.inventrio.com/csm/tags/caGrid-CSM_1_3_1_beta4</tt>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This source tree includes two projects. The project named
			<tt>csm</tt> is the CSM service. The project named
			<tt>csm-ui</tt> is the GAARDS client for the service.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can find documentation for the 1.3 version of the CSM service and
			client at
			<tt><a href="https://www.cagrid.org/display/csm13/Home">https://www.cagrid.org/display/csm13/Home</a>
			</tt>. This documentation does not include information on how to configure
			instance-level CSM authorization policies. Configuration of CSM
			authorization policies is described in the accompanying word document
			<tt>Configuration.docx</tt>.
