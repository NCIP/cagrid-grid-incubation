Downloading and building the SDK example project:


http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/svnroot/cacoresdk/tags/CACORESDK_42_QA_11032009. Unless we find a show stopper, we will not change anything in this codebase except the ivysettings.xml to point to cagrid 1.3.0.2 release repository. I will send this tag to the QA team as well.

With this tag, you can use following commands 

-	ant build-system : this target creates output directory without downloading containers (should execute in about 2 minutes). You should be using this target for your build.
-	ant deploy-system: this target downloads jboss and tomcat. It further proceeds with the deployment 
-	ant deploy:local:install: this target builds and deploys the complete system

1	cd sdk-toolkit\example-project\build
2	Modify codegen.properties and install.properties
	* install.properties has DB_* properties you need to set, and container type
	* If you want to SDK to set up the database, comment the exclude.database property in install.properties
3	Execute the build
	* deploy:local:install
		** Builds everything, creates a distribution, installs a container for you
	* deploy:local:install:re-configure
		** Re-configures your container if you made changes in install.properties and redeploys
	* dist deploy:local:install:re-configure
		** Does what the deploy:local:install target does, but doesn't install a container
	* build-system
		** Works as expected, builds SDK, builds your project, lays out artifacts in dist dir
4	Output we depend on goes to sdk-toolkit\example-project\target\dist\exploded\output\example\package
