			CLM is a powerful set of auditing and logging tools implemented in a flexible and
			comprehensive solution. It consists of the following components * Event Logging - This
			feature provides a log4j-based solution allowing users to log events. Since this feature
			provides the ability to propagate and store user information, it can be used for
			anything from auditing a user to detecting security breaches * Automated Object State
			Logging - This tool provides an automated, hibernate based, object state logging
			mechanism used to log the changes to an objectâ€™s state * Asynchronous Logging to
			database - This feature provides a log4j based JDBC appender that can log the messages
			to the database asynchronously. Asynchronous logging increases performance for
			applications that generate a high volume of log messages * Query Interface - A new Query
			API provides programmatic access to the logs data. It also can return the result in form
			of an XML document. * Web-based Log Locator tool - This tool is a web-based application
			that displays, searches, and filters log messages. The interface can be used to retrieve
			logs based on a timestamp, user ID, log level, etc. Also LLT now utilize CSM for User
			Provisioning as well as security. </description>
