Not working:
Reference documents with spaces.

Refactored:
pulled entire system out of exist source code so that it could not be tied to any particular version or build system of exist and potentially later to not even exist at all.
replaced cgMDR with openMDR everywhere to make non program specific
replaced cancergrid with cagrid to make non program specific
removed xforms as xforms is still not standard supported in most browsers
added support for creating:
	reference docs
	conceptual domains
	object classes
	properties
	value domains
fixed issues with many pages that were not storing xml that validated against the schema
