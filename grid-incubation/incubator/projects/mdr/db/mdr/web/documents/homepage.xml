        <p>Welcome to the cancergrid ISO/IEC11179 compliant metadata repository.</p>
        <p>An ISO/IEC11179 metadata repository is a resource where the meaning and allowed values of
            measurements are declared by linking terms in controlled vocabularies - such as SNOMED
            CT - to value domains restricting the values that may be assigned through the
            declaration of <i>data elements</i> - reusable definitions of measurement or declaration
            of clinical variables. This is the place where the meaning and derivation of the
            elements of National Minimum Dataset for Cancer can be properly declared and maintained.</p>
        <p>By reusing these measurement you guarantee that the data you collect is interoperable
            with other people who collect the same type of data. In conjunction of models of
            experiments - such as the CONSORT model for clinical trials - it facilitates the type of
            meta-analysis previously only achieved by a few groups such as the Early Breast Cancer
            Triallists' Collaborative Group.</p>
        <p>Here you will find the definitions of clinical and bioinformatic measurements of interest
            to clinicians and bioinformaticians in the cancergrid project. You can <a href="contents.xquery">browse them alphabetically</a>, <a href="search.xquery">search for text</a> within the names and definitions, inspect the underlying <a href="../model/index.htm" target="_blank">data model of the repository</a>, or read some <a href="documentation.xquery">useful documents</a> that describe how this resource is
            maintained. </p>
