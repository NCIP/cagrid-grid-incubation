This project is intended to help developers get started building their own custom CQL 2 query processors for caGrid data services.

The master build file (build.xml) will invoke Ivy to retrieve the requisite dependencies from the remote caGrid 1.4 repository.  Comments have been added to the build and ivy scripts to indicate what's going on.
