Get concept paths that map to something from the osuDSR.osu.edu caDSR Service:
  
select cd.concept_path from i2b2demodata.concept_dimension cd, i2b2demodata.ENCODING_DIMENSION ed, i2b2demodata.ENCODING_PROJECT ep, i2b2demodata.ENCODING_PROJECT_LINK epl, i2b2demodata.ENCODING_SERVICE es
  where cd.encoding_cd = ed.encoding_cd 
  and ed.encoding_cd = epl.encoding_cd
  and epl.encoding_project_id = ep.encoding_project_id
  and ep.encoding_service_id = es.encoding_service_id
  and ed.cde_public_id = 3432351 and es.service_url = 'osuDSR.osu.edu' and ep.project_name = 'i2b2' and ep.project_version = '4.0';

Concept Dimension to Map Fact Tables

Concept Path, Concept Dimension

Observation fact - has concept_path.  That links to concept dimension.
Also in MAP_DATA_FACT -- can search for it in there - also MAP_AGGR_FACT (all aggregated fact data)
What's a numeric, varchar, or boolean, and which field is the data in.
TValChar = text, NValNum = numeric
Valtype_CD tells you which column the real data lives in
	Correlating like rows in fact tables by ENCOUNTER_NUM (Unofficially)
		Encounter table is not used, but that's how we tie related things in fact tables together
		"400 measurments of a person are taken, they all get the same encounter id"
		Lab data based on accession num
		"Virtual Row"
Everything else in there is "metadata"

Maps getting re-run - not putting anything in ValType_Cd.  Awsome.  Also, nothing in TVal_Char, or NVal_Num.  For trial bank stuff, there's no data in there, so the ValType_Cd doesn't get populated
