* CDE mapping in EA... what tagged value name do we need to put in there?  -- send to ROB

Ida's data is in sybase
Concept paths are populated

Rob is going to write 14 instance map scripts... to prakash.
	Those transform data into the miniOCRe format (wut?)
		An encoding format for the data in the DB
	Marks up encoding table with the CDEs
		Transforms what's in i2b2 into something usable (wut?)
		Concept dim paths will have associated records in the encoding table -- that's what we'll publish to the grid for this trial.
	Map scripts will "transform the data" and put it in map_fact or aggregate_fact table FROM observation_fact
	Concept paths point to which fact table the data lives in (I think?)
	
If I have a path, how do I get data from fact table
	Search all three, or do I know which table? -- no, search each table

Ontomapper puts the stuff in the encoding table which maps CDEs to instance data
