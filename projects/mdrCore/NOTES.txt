Not working:
Reference documents with spaces.

Still needed:
new data element page that can either add new object class property conceptual domain and value domain or use existing
new data element concept page that can either add new object class property data element conceptual domain and value domain or use existing
edit pages for all data types

Refactored:
pulled entire system out of exist source code so that it could not be tied to any particular version or build system of exist and potentially later to not even exist at all.
replaced openMDR with openMDR everywhere to make non program specific
fixed ability to find referring concepts correctly in many pages
created a global schema that includes all the schema parts that were defined for all the ISO parts.
replaced cancergrid with cagrid to make non program specific
removed xforms as xforms support in most browsers
added support for creating:
	reference docs
	conceptual domains
	object classes
	properties
	value domains
fixed issues with many pages that were not storing xml that validated against the schema
